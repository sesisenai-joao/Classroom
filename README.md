# Classroom

## Practical Exam for Systems Development course

A classroom system in Java developed for a System Development class! (it's in Portuguese). It uses Swing/Java for the Desktop app, as well as integration with MySQL (via ORMLite).

Capabilities:
- Classroom CRUD
- Activities CRUD
- Users (a Teacher can have lots of Classrooms and vice-versa)

Everything made in 2:45h for a practical exam here in my school!

It's also my first submission in Hack Club, so I'm using this to experiment the platform as well (sorry for any problems)!

### Requirements
- Java 23 or higher
- MySQL 9 or higher (set up root password as 'root' and run the db.sql file)
